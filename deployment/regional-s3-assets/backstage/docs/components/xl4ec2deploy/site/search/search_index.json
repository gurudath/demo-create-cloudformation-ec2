This module contains the necessary files for configuring a CMS on AWS module to be deployed via CMS Backstage. Compare the CMS Sample module file structure and files against existing CMS on AWS modules for a better idea of how to customize the CMS Sample module for your own usage. For more information and a detailed deployment guide, visit the Connected Mobility Solution on AWS solution page. AWS CDK and Solutions Constructs \u00b6 AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) and AWS Solutions Constructs make it easier to consistently create well-architected infrastructure applications. All AWS Solutions Constructs are reviewed by AWS and use best practices established by the AWS Well-Architected Framework. In addition to the AWS Solutions Constructs, the solution uses AWS CDK directly to create infrastructure resources. Customizing the Module \u00b6 Prerequisites \u00b6 Python 3.8+ NVM NPM 8+ Node 18+ Pipenv MacOS Installation Instructions \u00b6 Pyenv Github Repository 1 2 brew install pyenv pyenv install 3 .10.9 Pipenv Github Repository 1 2 pip install --user pipenv pipenv install --dev NVM Github Repository 1 curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash NPM/Node Official Documentation 1 2 nvm install 18 nvm use 18 Clone the Repository \u00b6 1 2 git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions/connected-mobility-solution-on-aws.git cd connected-mobility-solution-on-aws/source/modules/cms_sample/ Install Required Dependencies \u00b6 1 make install Unit Test \u00b6 After making changes, run unit tests to make sure added customization pass the tests: 1 make test Build the Module \u00b6 The build script manages dependencies, builds required assets (e.g. packaged lambdas), and creates the AWS Cloudformation templates. 1 make build Upload Assets to S3 \u00b6 1 make upload Deploy on AWS \u00b6 1 make deploy Delete \u00b6 1 make destroy Cost Scaling \u00b6 There is no cost the CMS Sample module. For more details, see the implementation guide . Collection of Operational Metrics \u00b6 This solution collects anonymized operational metrics to help AWS improve the quality and features of the solution.
